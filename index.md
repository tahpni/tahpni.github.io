[//]: # (write a bit about yourself here)
Hi, I'm Om Kulkarni, a junior at Rutgers University. I'm majoring in Cell Biology and Neuroscience on the premed track, with a minor in Psychology.
I'm also self-studying Computer Science with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence. 

Here on my GitHub Pages site, you'll find a variety of my work:

**AI Projects**: What I've learned in trying to teach myself Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
**MCAT Preparation**: Tools and resources to aid in my journey towards medical school.

When I'm not studying or working on projects, I enjoy reading and working out.

I'm also actively involved in volunteer work at hospitals, contributing to programs like HELP and TCAB at various hospital locations, such as Hackensack University Medical Center and JFK University Medical Center.

Feel free to explore my projects, connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/taphni) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/om-k-6b66a3272/), and reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas.
